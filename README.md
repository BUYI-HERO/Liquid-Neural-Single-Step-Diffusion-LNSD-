Liquid Neural Single-Step Diffusion

Note: Code Release Pending  

This repository will contain the official implementation of our paper "Liquid Neural Single-Step Diffusion" (accepted at [Conference Name]). The code and pre-trained models will be made available upon publication.

📖 Overview

This work introduces Liquid Neural Single-Step Diffusion (LNSD), a novel diffusion-based framework that combines liquid neural networks with single-step diffusion sampling for efficient and expressive image generation. Our method achieves competitive performance with significantly reduced inference steps compared to traditional diffusion models.


📋 Prerequisites

The code will require:
• Python ≥ 3.8

• PyTorch ≥ 1.12

• CUDA ≥ 11.3

• Other dependencies (to be specified)
